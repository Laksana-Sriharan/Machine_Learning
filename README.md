<h1>MATLAB Machine Learning Concepts</h1>
This repository contains MATLAB scripts and functions implementing various machine learning algorithms and concepts explored throughout the semester. These codes are intended to serve as practical examples to deepen understanding and facilitate experimentation with machine learning techniques.

<h3>Contents:</h3>

<b>k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN):</b>

Implementation of the k-nearest neighbors algorithm for classification.
Script: k_nearest_neighbors.m
Support Vector Machines (SVM):

<b>MATLAB code for SVM implementation with various kernels (linear, polynomial, Gaussian).</b>
Script: svm.m


Each script is documented and includes comments explaining the purpose of the code, its inputs, and outputs. Users can simply run these scripts in MATLAB or Octave environment to observe the behavior of the respective machine learning algorithm on sample datasets provided.

Feel free to explore, modify, and experiment with the codes to gain a deeper understanding of machine learning concepts covered in the course.

Feel free to customize this description according to the specific algorithms and concepts covered in your semester. This description provides an overview of what the repository contains and how users can utilize the provided MATLAB scripts.
